== Preparing a system for EUS

Before you subscribe your system to an EUS release, it is important to
note which release your system is running. This information is stored in
the file `+/etc/redhat-release+`

....
cat /etc/redhat-release
....

[source,bash]
----
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.4 (Ootpa)
----

At this point, your system is not configured for EUS. If you were to run
a `+dnf update+` with this configuration, no packages would be available
because the standard 8.4 repositories are no longer live.

....
dnf list --updates
....

[source,bash]
----
# dnf list --updates
Updating Subscription Management repositories.

In order to restore your system to a patchable state, you will need to
disable the standard repositories and enable the EUS-specific repos.

*Please note:* There are TWO repos that need to be unregistered. The
baseos repo consists of all the packages essential for supporting the
Linux Kernel, systemd, and other critical system functions. The
AppStream (or Application Stream) repository houses workloads, like
language libraries and databases. You will then re-register the EUS
version of these repositories.

....
subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
....

[source,bash]
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
Repository 'rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms' is disabled for this system.
# subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
Repository 'rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms' is disabled for this system.
----

Next, enable the EUS repositories.

*Pro Tip*: You can combine these two operations into a single command!

....
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-eus-rpms --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-eus-rpms
....

[source,bash]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-eus-rpms --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-eus-rpms
Repository 'rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-eus-rpms' is enabled for this system.
Repository 'rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-eus-rpms' is enabled for this system.
----

Now that your system has the EUS repositories enabled, in the next step,
you will actually go through the process of updating packages from the
EUS repo.
