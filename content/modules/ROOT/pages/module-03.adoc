Now that your system has the EUS repositories registered, query your
system to see how many packages are available for update. (This will be
important to note in the next step.)

....
dnf list --updates| wc -l
....

[source,bash]
----
# dnf list --updates| wc -l
43
----

It is now time to update to the latest packages in our EUS release.
Before proceeding with the update, it is usually advisable to clean the
DNF cache as it removes existing metadata and pulls down an updated
listing for the new repositories.

....
dnf clean all
dnf update -y
....

Note: Your systemâ€™s output may vary slightly from the example:

[source,bash]
----
# dnf clean all
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
34 files removed

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - AppStream - Extended Update Support (RPMs)
... Output Truncated ...
Complete!

Now that you have the lastest packages availble in this EUS
repositories, verify the minor version of RHEL is the same as Step 2:

....
cat /etc/redhat-release
....

[source,bash]
----
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.4 (Ootpa)
----

Notice that with all the latest available packages installed, the server
is still running RHEL 8.4. There is a newer EUS release available. In
the final step, you will see how to upgrade between EUS versions.
