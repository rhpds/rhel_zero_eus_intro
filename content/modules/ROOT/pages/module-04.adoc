While EUS versions are supported for 24 months, it is a good practice to
stay on as current a release as possible. However, some environments
require recertification or are running software that the vendor only
certifies for specific minor releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. In
those circumstances, upgrading between EUS releases is the necessary
balance.

In order to see which releases are available for your system’s current
major release, you will use the `+subscription-manager+` command:

....
subscription-manager release --list
....

[source,bash]
----
# subscription-manager release --list
+-------------------------------------------+
          Available Releases
+-------------------------------------------+
8
8.0
8.1
8.2
8.3
8.4
8.5
8.6
8.7
----

Before you upgrade to the lastest minor EUS release, it is worth noting
that checks are built-in to ensure a system doesn’t inadvertantly get
updated to the absolute latest release. For instance, RHEL 8.7 is the
current minor release but is _not_ an EUS release. Try setting 8.7 as
the current release:

....
subscription-manager release --set=8.7
dnf clean all
dnf list --updates| wc -l
....

[source,bash]
----
# subscription-manager release --set=8.7
Release set to: 8.7
# dnf clean all
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
17 files removed
# dnf list --updates| wc -l

You receive several errors indicating the requested content could not be
found. Now, select the correct release and verify there are packages
available for update:

....
subscription-manager release --set=8.6
dnf clean all
dnf list --updates| wc -l
....

[source,bash]
----
# subscription-manager release --set=8.6
Release set to: 8.6
# dnf clean all
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
17 files removed
# dnf list --updates| wc -l

(Note that 318 is an estimated number and may vary depending on the
available packages at the time your lab was built.)

Now that you have the latest EUS release selected, run a dnf update:

....
dnf update -y
....

[source,bash]
----
# dnf update -y
